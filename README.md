# Morpion

A bot to play noughts and crosses on a discord server, using Javacord.

## Getting Started

You first need to create a Discord bot. Then, create a file named "token.txt" containing your bot token.
Place this file on the same directory as your .jar or project.
Then, you only have to launch the thing.
A line should appear with a link to invite your bot to a server.

### Prerequisites

You need something to be able to run Java and Maven.
Nothing else should be required.

### Installing

Once you build the .jar using Maven, just execute it.

```
mvn package
java -jar morpion.jar
```

## Running the tests

There is currently no test

### Break down into end to end tests

## Deployment

Just launch the jar, do not forget the tonke.txt file.
