# Morpion

A bot to play noughts and crosses on a discord server, using Javacord.

## Getting Started

You first need to create a Discord bot. Then, create a file named "token.txt" containing your bot token.
Place this file on the same directory as your .jar or project.
Then, you only have to launch the thing.
A line should appear with a link to invite your bot to a server.

### Prerequisites

You need something to be able to run Java 1.8 and Maven.
Nothing else should be required.

### Installing

Once you build the .jar using Maven, just execute it.

```
mvn package
```

Then, move the jar file created (in target/) close to your token.txt and launch the app

```
java -jar morpion-0.0.1.jar
```


## Running the tests
